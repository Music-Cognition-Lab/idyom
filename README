IDYOM: Information Dynamics of Music
Version 2.0 alpha

==Documentation==

Documentation on how to install and use the system can be found on the
IDyOM wiki at Sound Software
(https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/idyom-project/wiki).
Currently a login is required, but a public version is planned.

The design of the system and its underlying principles are documented
in Marcus Pearce's PhD thesis "The Construction and Evaluation of
Statistical Models of Melodic Structure in Music Perception and
Composition" (2005) - see thesis.pdf

==Requirements==

SBCL              http://www.sbcl.org 

Though not required, IDyOM is most easily installed using quicklisp:

http://www.quicklisp.org/

see the wiki for details.

==Top-level function==

idyom:idyom

For detailed documentation, see the wiki:

==Directory Structure==

The layout of the code is as follows: 

* idyom.asd: the system definition 

* utils/: general-purpose utilities 

* amuse/: an interface to amuse music data interface
** amuse-interface.lisp: look here to make this less dependent on amuse-mtp
** viewpoint-extensions.lisp: extensions to the viewpoint framework useful for modelling

* ppm/: the multiple-viewpoint system modelling framework
** params.lisp: user-level parameters to the statistical modelling 
** multiple-viewpoint-system.lisp: modelling with multiple-viewpoints 
** prediction-sets.lisp: representing and combining distributions, computing entropy and information content

* apps/: top-level applications for users 
** apps.lisp: pathnames and filenames for saving data and results
** main.lisp: top-level code for using the system
** resampling.lisp: the main user interface - estimating information content by cross-validation
** viewpoint-selection.lisp: on tin does it says the what
** generation.lisp: code for generating melodies (possibly suffering from bitrot)
