IDYOM: Information Dynamics of Music
Version 0.2 beta

Copyright 2013, Marcus Pearce (marcus.pearce@eecs.qmul.ac.uk)

This program is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License.  See COPYING for details.

==Documentation==

Documentation on how to install and use the system can be found on the
IDyOM wiki at Sound Software
(https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/idyom-project/wiki).
Currently a login is required, but a public version is planned.

The design of the system and its underlying principles are documented
in Marcus Pearce's PhD thesis "The Construction and Evaluation of
Statistical Models of Melodic Structure in Music Perception and
Composition" (2005) - see thesis.pdf

==Requirements==

SBCL              http://www.sbcl.org 

AMuSE		  https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/amuse
AMuSE Viewpoints  https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/amuse-viewpoints
MIPS  		  https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/mips
MTP-Admin	  https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/mtp-admin
PPM* 		  https://code.soundsoftware.ac.uk/projects/ppm-star

IDyOM can be easily installed using quicklisp - see the wiki for
details.

==Directory Structure==

The layout of the code is as follows: 

* idyom.asd: the system definition 

* utils/: general-purpose utilities 

* amuse/: an interface to amuse music data interface
** amuse-interface.lisp: look here to make this less dependent on amuse-mtp
** viewpoint-extensions.lisp: extensions to the viewpoint framework useful for modelling

* ppm/: the multiple-viewpoint system modelling framework
** params.lisp: user-level parameters to the statistical modelling 
** multiple-viewpoint-system.lisp: modelling with multiple-viewpoints 
** prediction-sets.lisp: representing and combining distributions, computing entropy
and information content

* apps/: top-level applications for users 
** apps.lisp: pathnames and filenames for saving data and results
** main.lisp: top-level code for using the system
** resampling.lisp: the main user interface - estimating information content
by cross-validation
** viewpoint-selection.lisp: on tin does it says the what
** generation.lisp: code for generating melodies (possibly suffering from bitrot)

==Top-level functions==

idyom:idyom
resampling:idyom-resample
resampling:output-information-content
